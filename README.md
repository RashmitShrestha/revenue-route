# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to Revenue Route! A financial tracker web app that lets you manage your transactions, see how much you spend on different categories of transactions, and gives you options to become better at managing your hard earned and carefully spent money

## Installing

Feel free to download the app through cloning the repository to your local machine or any other methods you prefer

Then run ```npm install``` to download all necessary packages through npm

After, go to ```.env``` and replace the private information with your own

After, run ```npm run dev``` to start the local development and get ready to save some money!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Full-Stack Design

For the front end I used React.js, along with React-Bootstrap, and Chart.js to draw graphs

Then for the backend, I used Firebase for both the database and authentication, which is harmoniously paired together, and the use of GET fetch requests to the Financial API

This is wrapped around Next.js with Typescript, as an added challenge 

Even though my inital vision was different, this project has been a joy to work on, and I hope you'll be able to feel that joy too

Thanks a ton!
